# CalculatorApp

A simple calculator app using swift and storyboard.
This an extension of the project taught in the udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/ .
In the course they teach the way to layout an app based on screen sizes.
I added logic to the same and made it work like a calculator.

This project uses NSexpression to calculate the result and display it on the screen.
It also uses storyboard as the choice of interface builder.
